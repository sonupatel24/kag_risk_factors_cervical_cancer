# kag_risk_factors_cervical_cancer
This notebook performs a complete end-to-end data analysis and machine learning pipeline on the Cervical Cancer Risk Factors dataset from Kaggle. The focus is on identifying the most significant risk factors and developing an accurate prediction model using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) â€” a powerful, efficient, and scalable tree-based machine learning algorithm.
